          VAR=9
          VAR=$(($VAR+1))


If the deletion has not been committed, the command below will restore the deleted file in the working tree.
         $ git checkout -- <file>

Read a line (-r is for ignoring backslash escapes, -a is for storing result in an array)
          EX1)
            IFS=' ' read -ra ADDR <<< "H e l lo;Guys;How;Are;You"
            for i in "${ADDR[@]}"; do
                    echo $i
            done

          EX2)
            #!/bin/bash
            IFS="," read -ra line<<<"hello,what,you"
            echo ${line[0]}


When you pass a variable to a function, make sure to put a double quotation to treat it as one argument:
          #!/bin/bash
          function takeFirstInArray(){
                  IFS=',' read -a ADDR <<< "$1" #THIS
                  for i in ${ADDR[@]} ; do
                          echo $i
                  done

          }
          for i in $(ls categories) ; do
                  while read -r line ; do
                          echo $line
                          takeFirstInArray "$line" #THIS
                  done < categories/$i
          done
